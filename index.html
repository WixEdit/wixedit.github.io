  <h2 id="latest-version">Latest version</h2>
  <p>
    This version of WixEdit contains a new wizard to help you create new msi 
    files from scratch. The wizard helps you to create a working installer 
    with files and functionality like shortcuts, virtual directories, user 
    interface and more in a few clicks! Please let me know what templates you
    wish to see in the wizard, or better provide small samples of which 
    templates can be made!
  </p>

  <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
  <p>
    The main goal is to help create MSI installers using the WiX toolset.
    This project helps to edit WiX source files, and gives you a better 
    overview over your installer. It will still be necessary to have some
    knowledge about the WiX toolset, but the program helps to display the
    files in a structured manner and maintain an better overview while
    navigating through the wxs file. But for simple installations, the
    wizard will guide you till a working installation.
